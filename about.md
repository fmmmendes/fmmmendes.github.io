My name is Filipe Mendes, I'm a data enthusiastic, learning between both worlds of Data Science and Data Engineering. I've worked 7 years as a Field Engineer in Electric Energy Sector, desiging and testing Control and Proction Systems. During those year I had some contact with data, by testing and validating signals in diferent protocols (IEC6185, IEC 60870,...) between IEDs (Inteligent Eletronic Devices) and Local/Remote Systems.
