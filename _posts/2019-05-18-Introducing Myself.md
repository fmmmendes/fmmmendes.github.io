Hello there, I'm Filipe.  

I consider myself as a data enthusiastic, and I enjoy to explore both worlds of data science and engineering. I'm started my career in 2008 as a Field Engineer, working 7 years on Electric Industry. In 2015, I've decide to start a new chalange working with data. I become an R developer and acquired skills in data cleanning, ETL processes anda data visualization. Recently, I had more contact with Big Data tools as PySpark and Hive. When I have spare time, I like to mix music.

I hope with this blog to share some of my experiences when I'm having fun with data.
