Hello there, I'm Filipe. I consider myself as a data enthusiastic, and I enjoy to explore both worlds of data science and engineering. I'm started my career in 2008 as a Field Engineer, working 7 years on Electric Industry. During that experience I was resposible to preform factory tests and site tests on IED's (Inteligente Electronic Devices). In 2015, I've decide to start a new chalange working with data. I become an R developer and arquired some skills as Data Cleanning and ETL processes. Recently, I had contact with diferent tools in data visualization (Power BI, Shiny Apps), data processing with Big Data tools (PySpark), and automation and environments (Ansible, Docker and Vagrant). I hope with this blog to share some of my experiences when I'm having fun with data.
