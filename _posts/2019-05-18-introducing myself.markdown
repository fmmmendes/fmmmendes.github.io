Hello there, I'm Filipe. I consider myself as a data enthusiastic, and I enjoy to explore both worlds of data science and engineering. I'm started my career in 2008 as a Field Engineer, working 7 years on Electric Industry. During that experience I was resposible to preform factory tests and site tests on IED's (Inteligente Electronic Devices), including signaling validation between local (Protectino and Control) and remote systems (SCADA). After 7 year I've decide to start a new chalange working with data more closely between diferent sectors. I become an R developer and arquired some skills related to cleanning data and ETL. The last 4 years there was a lot of contact with diferent tools as Power BI for data visualization, Apache Spark (PySpark) for Big Data processes, Docker, Ansible and Vagrant for quick enviroment deployment. Seeing the current Big Data Landscape, there is a huge path to learn a litle more from the others tecnologies. I hope with this blog to share some of my experiences when I'm having fun with data.
